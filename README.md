# 5DAYWEATHERAPI
# 🏗️ Module 6 Challenge

* Using specific parameters to a URL, this application uses a weather dashboard (which runs in the browser) that updates dynamically in HTML and CSS.
When searching for a city, current and future conditions for the city are shown, as well as the search history being added and saved, locally.
The current city name, date and icon representation of weather conditions, temp, humidity and wind speed are presented in a 5--day forecast with the date displayed at the top of the page.
